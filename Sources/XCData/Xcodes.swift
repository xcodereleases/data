        // being considered as "current", since nothing supercedes it.
        //
        // PROBLEM: How do we reliably detect this, while still allowing for new
        // prerelease versions of non-latest releases?
        // ex: 15.2 is released, but there's a 15.1.2 RC with a critical bug fix.
        //
        // SOLUTION: The policy this will take is that only the two most recent major versions
        // will be considered "current".
        // ex: 16.0 beta can be current while 15.x is current
        //
        // CAVEAT: This would fail if a past Xcode (14.x) gets a critical update while
        // 15.x and 16.x are current.
        
        // get the largest major version of these "current" Xcodes
        let latestMajorVersion = currentXcodes.map(\.majorVersion).max()!
        
        // build a range that includes the largest major version and the version prior to it
        let rangeOfCurrentMajorVersions = (latestMajorVersion-1) ... latestMajorVersion
        
        // remove all Xcodes that are not from the two latest major versions
        currentXcodes = currentXcodes.filter { rangeOfCurrentMajorVersions.contains($0.majorVersion) }
